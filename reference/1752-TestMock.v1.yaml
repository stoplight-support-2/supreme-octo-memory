    ### Overview
    Represents an order which consists of at least one line item and one fulfilment.

    A line item is simply a individual item/product/SKU that the customer wishes to purchase, while a fulfilment represents "how" the order will make its way to the customer.

    ### Fulfilments
    At a high-level we currently support two "types" of fulfilments: self-collection and delivery.

    A self-collection fulfilment is denoted with a type a `type` of `dine_in`, `take_away` or `self_serve`, and indicates that the customer is responsible for retrieving the order from the merchant. A delivery filfillment is denoted with a type of `delivery` and indicates that either the merchant or a third party will physically take the order to the customer.

    Regardless of the fulfilment type, some basic rules always apply:

    - An order may automatically be accepted on behalf of the merchant, however if explicit acceptance is required `merchant_must_accept_before` will be set.
    - A customer can cancel an order up to the point that the merchant accepts the order.
    - A merchant can cancel an order up to the point that a customer collects it or it is sucesfully delivered to the customer.
